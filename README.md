## Image Gallery v2

This is a WIP meant to replace !(https://github.com/Hugoyhu/Image-Gallery)[the original Image Gallery], which I currently use as a photography portfolio. v2 will use nextJS and Tailwind CSS instead of HTML / CSS, and additionally replace Supabase with MongoDB for storage. v2 will continue to use Cloudinary as a CDN.
