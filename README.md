## Image Gallery v2

This is a WIP meant to replace [the original Image Gallery](https://github.com/Hugoyhu/Image-Gallery). v2 uses nextJS and Tailwind CSS instead of HTML / CSS, and additionally replace Supabase with MongoDB for storage. v2 will continue to use Cloudinary as a CDN. 

This project is live at [photography.hugohu.me](https://photography.hugohu.me) and is hosted on Vercel.
